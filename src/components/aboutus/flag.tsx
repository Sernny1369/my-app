                In 2009, the Ministry of Defence granted the NTC a 'defaced ensign', the first in nearly 40 years! 
                The ensign bears the Union Flag Cross and the Corps Badge Tudor Rose, symbolizing our country's faith 
                and traditions, closely aligned with the Royal Navy uniform.

                Our present uniform and training are rooted in centuries-old traditions of great sea adventurers, 
                emphasizing discipline but foremost, youth development.

                Our units follow a structured nautical-themed training program, promoting practical application of theoretical 
                knowledge
